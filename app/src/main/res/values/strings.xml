        Sanskrit is a classical language belonging to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European languages.
        It arose in South Asia after its predecessor languages had diffused there from the northwest in the late Bronze Age.
        Sanskrit is the sacred language of Hinduism, the language of classical Hindu philosophy,
        and of historical texts of Buddhism and Jainism. It was a link language in ancient and medieval South Asia,
        and upon transmission of Hindu and Buddhist culture to Southeast Asia, East Asia and Central Asia in the early medieval era,
        it became a language of religion and high culture, and of the political elites in some of these regions.As a result,
        Sanskrit had a lasting effect on the languages of South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia,
        especially in their formal and learned vocabularies.</string>

        Assamese[a] or Asamiya (অসমীয়া [ɔxɔmija])is an Indo-Aryan language spoken mainly in the north-eastern Indian state of Assam,
        where it is an official language. It serves as a lingua franca of the wider region and has over 15 million native speakers
        according to Ethnologue.Nefamese, an Assamese-based pidgin in Arunachal Pradesh, was used as the lingua franca till it was replaced by Hindi;
        and Nagamese, an Assamese-based Creole language,continues to be widely used in Nagaland.
        The Kamtapuri language of Rangpur division of Bangladesh and the Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri districts of India are
        linguistically closer to Assamese, though the speakers identify with the Bengali culture and the literary language.
        In the past, it was the court language of the Ahom kingdom from the 17th century.
        Along with other Eastern Indo-Aryan languages, Assamese evolved at least before the 7th century CE[10] from the middle
        Indo-Aryan Magadhi Prakrit.Its sister languages include Angika, Bengali, Bishnupriya Manipuri, Chakma, Chittagonian,
        Hajong, Rajbangsi, Maithili, Rohingya and Sylheti. It is written in the Assamese alphabet, an abugida system,

    <string name="gondi">
        Gondi (Gōṇḍī), natively known as Koitur (Kōī, Kōītōr), is a South-Central Dravidian language, spoken by about
        three million Gondi people,chiefly in the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh,
        Telangana and by small minorities in neighbouring states. Although it is the language of the Gond people, it is highly
        endangered, with only one fifth of Gonds speaking the language. Gondi has a rich folk literature, examples of which are
        wedding songs and narrations. Gondi people are ethnically related to the Telugus.
        The origin of the name Gond, used by outsiders, is still uncertain. Some believe the word to derive from the Dravidian kond, meaning hill, similar to the Khonds of Odisha.
        Another theory, according to Vol. 3 of the Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life, is that the name was given to them by the Mughal dynasty of the 16th–18th centuries.
        It was the Mughals who first used the term "Gond", meaning "hill people", to refer to the group.
